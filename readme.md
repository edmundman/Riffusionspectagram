You can run the script with the following command:

```Shell
python spectrogram_generator.py <path_to_music_folder> <path_to_output_folder>
```

Be sure to replace `<path_to_music_folder>` with the path to your folder full of music and `<path_to_output_folder>` with the path where you want to save the generated spectrograms.
